\section{Aim}
In this assignment, we have made a Random number generator using shift registers.

\section{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We connected the 555 timer circuit.
  \item Then we connected the Clock output of the 555 timer circuit to the clock signal of D-Flip flops.
  \item Now we make the circuit for shift registers using 4 D-Flip flops (using two 7474 IC's).
  \item Then we connected XOR gate (7486 IC).
  \item We connected the decoder (7447 IC) and connected its A, B, C, D with Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3 respectively.
  \item Then we connected the seven-segmented display and connected it with the decoder (7447 IC).
  \item We connected all the independent parts with each other and then connected the power source.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
The output was changing digits on the seven-segment display.
